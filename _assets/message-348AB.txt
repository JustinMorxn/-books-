Edit the provided image (the clean Stage 1 plate). Add text only.

ABSOLUTE PRESERVATION (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Do not change any pixel of the existing illustration (astronaut, halo, antenna, speed lines, dash marks) or the black background.
- The ONLY pixels that may change are the pixels that form the two text elements (the inside of the letters). No other edits.
- No grain, no texture, no stars, no dust, no gradients, no vignette, no banding, no haze, no glow bloom.

ADD ONLY THESE TWO TEXT ELEMENTS (spelled exactly, no other text)
1) Angels and Spaceships
2) The Lights in the Sky are Stars

TITLE BLOCK: PLACEMENT (PIN IT DOWN)
- Place the entire two-line title block in the upper-left region.
- Left margin about 8% of canvas width.
- Top margin about 6% of canvas height.
- The title block must fit entirely above about 32% of canvas height (so it never crowds the astronaut).
- Do not overlap any illustration marks.

TITLE LAYOUT (MATCH OG FEEL, NOT NECESSARILY 1:1 POSITION)
- Line 1: “Angels” large. “and” smaller on the same line, placed to the right.
- Line 2: “Spaceships” large beneath, spanning wider than “Angels”.
- Size relationships:
  - “and” cap height about 60% of “Angels” cap height.
  - “Spaceships” cap height about 110% of “Angels” cap height.

TITLE LETTERING STYLE (HAND-LETTERED, NOT A FONT)
- Chunky, rounded, mid-century hand-lettered display lettering.
- Slight playful irregularity: small baseline wobble, uneven letter widths, tiny shape quirks.
- Must NOT look like a modern digital font. Avoid perfect uniformity and perfect curves.
- Visible OG-like traits:
  - The capital “A” is tall and blocky with a triangular inner counter.
  - The “g” in “Angels” has a descending tail that hooks.
  - The capital “S” in “Spaceships” is slightly oversized and more decorative than the other letters.
- No bevel, no 3D, no drop shadow, no texture inside letters.

TITLE COLOR (MIDDLE GROUND, FLAT INK, NO GRADIENTS)
- Each letter is a single flat solid fill color. NO gradients, NO shading, NO highlights.
- Use a left-to-right rainbow progression across the full title:
  blues/teals on the left, then greens, then yellows, then oranges, ending in pink/red at the far right.
- Use these as target ink colors (allow slight variation but keep the same vibe):
  Blue #456F9F, Teal #608493, Green #728F82, Yellow #F7E013 (or duller #E7DA2D),
  Orange #ED8A5A, Pink-red #ED5B78.
- Keep colors saturated but printed-ink restrained, not neon-sign bright.

TAGLINE: PLACEMENT + STYLE (QUIET)
- Add: “The Lights in the Sky are Stars”
- Place near the bottom, centered, with comfortable margins:
  baseline around 92% of canvas height.
- Make it small and understated:
  cap height about 3% of canvas height.
- Simple clean book-cover line lettering, flatter and more restrained than the title.
- Flat solid fill, no gradient, no shadow, no texture.
- Use a quiet muted teal-blue (target #608493) with low brightness so it does not compete with the art.

AURA / EDGE ENERGY
- Do NOT add any glow or aura in this version. Keep letter edges clean and crisp.
  (We can add a hairline edge later only if everything else is perfect and it does not lift the black.)

FINAL FAIL CONDITIONS (REJECT AND REGENERATE IF ANY OCCUR)
- Any change to the illustration or background outside the letter shapes.
- Any gradients inside letters.
- Any haze, glow bloom, or background lift.
- Any extra text besides the two required lines.
