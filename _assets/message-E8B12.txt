Edit the provided Stage 1 image.

PRIMARY GOAL
Add ONLY these two text elements, spelled exactly:
1) “Angels and Spaceships”
2) “The Lights in the Sky are Stars”
No other text.

PRESERVE STAGE 1 (ABSOLUTE)
Do not move, resize, rotate, redraw, or alter any existing illustration elements (astronaut, halo, antenna, speed lines, dash marks).
Do not add or remove any marks.
Do not add grain, texture, stars, dust, gradients, vignette, or banding.
Keep the background perfectly uniform solid #050508. Do not lift or brighten the black.

TITLE LAYOUT (MATCH THE COVER FEEL)
Two-line title in the upper portion:
- Line 1: “Angels” large at top-left. “and” smaller to the right on the same line.
- Line 2: “Spaceships” large beneath, spanning wide.
Keep generous negative space around the title. Do not overlap any illustration elements.

TITLE LETTERING STYLE
Hand-lettered, chunky, rounded mid-century display lettering with slight playful irregularity.
Not a modern font. No bevel/3D. No drop shadow. No texture inside the letters.

TITLE COLOR (RESTRAINED, “DARKER ENERGY”)
Each letter is a flat SOLID fill color (no gradients, no internal shading).
Use a left-to-right rainbow progression across the full title:
cool blues/teals on the left, then greens/yellows, then oranges, ending in pink/red on the far right.
Keep the title saturated but subtly less bright than a neon sign, so the black void remains dominant.

SUBTLE “DARKSABER” EDGE ENERGY (TEXT ONLY, VERY TIGHT)
Add a very subtle edge aura that hugs the outside of the letter contours:
- The solid letter fills remain crisp and dominant.
- The aura is hairline-thin and tight to the edges. No wide glow, no haze, no fog.
- Use a faint neutral rim plus a very faint tint matching each letter’s color.
- No light spill into the black. Do not alter the background.

BOTTOM TAGLINE PLACEMENT
Add “The Lights in the Sky are Stars” near the bottom area with comfortable margins, small and understated.
Do not overlap the astronaut or motion marks.

BOTTOM TAGLINE STYLE
Simple, clean book-cover line lettering (more restrained than the chunky title).
Flat solid fill (no gradients). Keep it readable but quiet.
Optional: the same tight edge aura as the title, but weaker (nearly imperceptible).
No shadows. No texture. No background changes.

FINAL CHECKS
Only the two requested text elements exist.
Background remains perfectly uniform #050508.
No changes to the illustration layer.
No haze, bloom, or banding.
