V4 FINAL — STAGE 2 TEXT OVERLAY (EDIT THE PROVIDED STAGE 1 PLATE)

Edit the provided image (the clean Stage 1 plate). Add text only.

ABSOLUTE PRESERVATION (HARD RULE)
- Do NOT move, resize, rotate, redraw, repaint, or alter any existing illustration pixels (astronaut, halo, antenna, speed lines, dash marks) or the black background.
- The ONLY allowed new pixels are the pixels inside the two text elements.
- No added texture anywhere: no grain, no paper sheen, no diagonal streaks, no dust, no stars, no gradients in the background, no banding, no vignette.
- No glow haze, no bloom, no fog. Do not lift the black.

ADD ONLY THESE TWO TEXT ELEMENTS (EXACT SPELLING, NO OTHER TEXT)
1) Angels and Spaceships
2) The Lights in the Sky are Stars

TITLE: PLACEMENT + LAYOUT (TOP)
- Place the title in the upper-left / upper area with generous breathing room.
- Keep the entire title block above the top third of the canvas so it never crowds the astronaut.
- Two lines:
  Line 1: “Angels” large at top-left. “and” smaller on the same line to the right.
  Line 2: “Spaceships” large beneath, spanning wider than “Angels”.
- Keep a clear gap between the bottom of “Spaceships” and any illustration marks.

TITLE: LETTERING STYLE (HAND-LETTERED MID-CENTURY)
- Chunky, rounded, hand-lettered mid-century display lettering with slight playful irregularity.
- Must NOT look like a modern digital font: include subtle baseline wobble and tiny shape quirks.
- No bevel/3D, no drop shadow, no texture inside letters.

TITLE: COLOR BEHAVIOR (MATCH THE COVER FEEL)
- Each letter uses a SINGLE flat solid fill color (no gradients inside any letter, no shading, no highlights).
- Left-to-right rainbow progression across the full title:
  blues/teals on the left → greens → yellows → oranges → pink/red on the far right.
- Saturated but “printed ink” restrained (not neon-sign bright).

TAGLINE: PLACEMENT + STYLE (BOTTOM, QUIET)
- Add “The Lights in the Sky are Stars” near the bottom with comfortable margins, centered.
- Make it clearly secondary: smaller and lighter than the title.
- Simple clean book-cover line lettering (more restrained than the title).
- Flat solid fills only. No shadows. No texture. No glow haze.

TAGLINE: COLOR BEHAVIOR (CRITICAL FIX — DO NOT COLLAPSE TO ONE COLOR)
- The tagline must show a clear left-to-right multi-color progression similar to the title.
- To ensure the progression is visible even at small size, color the tagline by word-groups (flat fills, no gradients):
  Group 1 “The Lights” = teal/blue
  Group 2 “in the Sky” = green/yellow
  Group 3 “are Stars” = orange/pink
- Keep these colors dimmer than the title (about 20–35% lower brightness) while still visibly multi-colored.
- Do NOT render the entire tagline in a single color.

AURA / EDGE ENERGY
- Do NOT add any aura/glow in this version. Keep edges crisp and clean.

FINAL FAIL CONDITIONS (REJECT IF ANY HAPPEN)
- Any changes to the illustration or background outside the text shapes.
- Any gradients or shading inside letters.
- Any extra text.
- Any haze/glow/banding/texture introduced anywhere.
- Tagline appears mostly single-color instead of clearly multi-colored across groups.
