Using the provided cover photos as strict visual reference, generate ONE single clean digital redraw of the FRONT COVER ONLY. Not a photo, not a scan, not a collage. It must look like a pristine “as-intended” restoration of the original design: perfect flat geometry, no physical wear, no camera distortion.

FORMAT AND FRAMING
- Aspect ratio: 2:3 portrait.
- Full cover, perfectly front-facing, flat rectangle. No spine, no perspective tilt, no curvature, no border.

BACKGROUND (ABSOLUTE)
- A perfectly uniform deep near-black field, solid hex #050508.
- No stars, no speckles, no dust, no grain, no paper texture, no print texture, no halftone, no stipple.
- No gradient, no vignette, no lighting falloff.

TEXT (ONLY THIS, EXACT)
- Include only the title text: “Angels and Spaceships”
- No other text anywhere. No author name, no tagline, no publisher, no logos, no watermark, no signature, no extra symbols.

TITLE LAYOUT (MATCH REFERENCE)
- Place title in the upper portion with generous surrounding black space.
- Two-line structure exactly:
  Line 1: “Angels” large at top-left. “and” smaller to the right on the same line.
  Line 2: “Spaceships” large beneath, spanning most of the width.

TITLE STYLE
- Hand-lettered, chunky, rounded mid-century display letters with slight human irregularity, slightly clumsy and wobbly like the original, not a modern computer font.
- No outlines, no drop shadows, no 3D, no bevel.
- Color behavior is critical: each letter is a solid fill color (no gradient inside any letter). Rainbow progression happens letter-by-letter across the title, cooler blues/teals on the left shifting through greens and yellows into oranges and ending in pinks/reds on the right.

MAIN ART (ASTRONAUT, VIEWPOINT AND POSE ARE CRITICAL)
- Place astronaut in the lower-right to center-right, traveling diagonally toward the upper-right.
- Viewpoint: astronaut is seen mostly from behind (rear or three-quarter rear). No face visible, no front visor view.
- Helmet must read as the back of a bubble helmet: a dark circular disk with a bright rim highlight.
- Pose is stiff and simple: torso straight, legs straight and held together, feet close. Arms reach forward/upward in a simple pose. Gloves are simplified shapes, not realistic fingers.
- NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS: no front-facing hero pose, no twisting torso, no dramatic action pose, no bent-knee running pose, no wide-splayed legs.

SUIT DESIGN (SIMPLIFIED, PERIOD GRAPHIC)
- Simplified segmented suit with tubular limbs and simple bands.
- Include the studded rivet-dot harness and belt motif around the torso area, stylized like the reference.
- Avoid modern suit paneling, realistic life-support packs, or complex tech seams.

LINE AND COLOR RENDERING
- Render the astronaut and marks as crisp luminous scratch-like strokes with bright centers and clean edges, high contrast on black.
- No painterly blending, no airbrush shading, no soft bloom, no blur. Not vector-icon flat either. Keep it like luminous drawn strokes on black.

HALO AND ANTENNA (CRITICAL)
- Above the helmet, draw a thin outlined ring as a flat ellipse with inner and outer contour lines (not a thick donut).
- A straight thin vertical antenna rod rises from the helmet and passes cleanly through the halo ring.

SPEED LINES (CRITICAL COUNTS AND MARKS)
- Exactly five rigid, straight, parallel lines extend back-left from behind the astronaut’s upper back, evenly spaced, hard-edged.
- Color progression across the five lines: cyan through green toward lime. Only the far-left ends gently fade.
- Add the intentional structure: an X-shaped brace across the five lines (two diagonal strokes that cross).
- Add exactly three short perpendicular tick marks near the right ends of the upper lines.
- NEGATIVE: no soft glowing trails, no smoke, no blur.

EXTRA MOTION MARKS
- Add a scattered cluster of short cyan/blue dash marks behind the lower body and boots, trailing back-left. These are dash marks, not stars.

FINISH
- Pristine, defect-free redraw. No wear, stains, scuffs, creases, glare, banding, or texture of any kind.
