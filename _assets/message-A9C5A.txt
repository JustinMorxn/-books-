Two-stage restoration. Stage 1 is art only with ZERO TEXT. Typography will be added later.
The reference photos are authoritative. Do not rebalance the design to compensate for missing text.

FORMAT
2:3 portrait. Front cover only. Perfectly flat front-facing rectangle.
No spine. No 3D book. No perspective tilt. No curvature. No border.

BACKGROUND
Perfectly uniform solid #050508. No stars. No speckles. No dust. No grain. No paper/print texture.
No halftone. No gradient. No vignette. No banding.

TEXT
No text of any kind anywhere.

TITLE KEEP-OUT ZONE
Reserve the top ~40% of the cover as a strict keep-out zone.
That entire zone must remain pure #050508 and visually inactive: no glow haze, no marks, no motion streaks, no highlights.
No part of the astronaut, halo, speed lines, or dash marks may enter this zone.

COMPOSITION
Keep generous negative space in the upper portion.
Place the astronaut in the lower-right to center-right region, traveling diagonally toward the upper-right.
Do not enlarge or center the astronaut to fill empty space.

ASTRONAUT
Rear or three-quarter rear view. No face visible. Helmet reads as the back of a bubble helmet with a rim highlight.
Stiff pose: torso straight, legs straight and held together, feet close.
Arms reach forward/upward. Gloves are simplified mitten-like shapes.
Simplified segmented suit with tubular limbs and simple bands.
Include studded rivet-dot harness and belt motif around torso.

RENDERING STYLE
Crisp luminous scratch-like strokes, bright centers, clean edges, high contrast on black.
No blur, no soft bloom, no airbrush shading.
No spray-dot speckling. Use scratch strokes and short hatching instead.
Not flat vector icon art.

HALO + ANTENNA
Thin outlined halo ring as a flat ellipse above the helmet.
Straight thin vertical antenna rises from helmet and passes through the halo.
Keep halo and antenna fully below the keep-out zone.

SPEED LINES
Exactly five rigid straight parallel lines extending back-left from behind the astronaut’s upper back.
Even spacing. Hard-edged lines. Gentle fade only at the far-left ends.
Color progression across the five lines: cyan through green toward lime.
Include the photo-accurate signature marks:
- One clean diagonal cross-stroke across the bundle of five lines.
- Exactly three short tick marks total, perpendicular to the lines, near the right ends of the TOP THREE lines only. No ticks on the bottom two lines.

EXTRA MOTION DASHES
A small scattered cluster of short cyan/blue dash marks behind the lower body and boots only, trailing back-left.
Dash marks only. Not dots. Not stars. Not grain. Confined to the boot region.

FINISH
Pristine, defect-free redraw of the illustration layer only. No wear, stains, scuffs, glare, or camera artifacts.
